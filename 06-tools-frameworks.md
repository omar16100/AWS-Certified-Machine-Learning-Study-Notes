## Tensorflow

Define graph up front and then run it

* Tensor: Multidimensional array that can hold data
* Graph: Flow of data

```python
import tensorflow as tf
```

## Pytorch

Creating the graph as you go along. Can be more dynamic than TF.

```python
import pytorch
```

## MXNet

Framework of AWS Sagemaker, similar to pytorch you create graphs on the fly.

```python
import mxnet as mx
from mxnet import nd #ndarray
from mxnet import autograd #autogradient
```

### TensorFlow

TensorFlow (backed by Google) is an end-to-end, open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources. This lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

### Keras

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

__Or, to put it another way:__

TensorFlow is a complex tool. Keras has been built on top of TensorFlow as a more user-friendly interface. It helps us rapidly prototype models, and we use it in this lab.
